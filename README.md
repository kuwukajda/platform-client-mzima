This Platform Client (Mzima) repo houses 2 clients: The web client and the mobile client. Find the installation instructions below.

#

### Requirements
- Memory (RAM) and storage: RAM - Minimum 8GB, 16GB is recommended for smoother multitasking; Storage - minimum 512GB. Consider 1TB if you plan to have multiple development environments. SSD storage is recommended for faster reading and writing speed
- Operating systems: Mac OS, Linux, windows (If you are having issues with windows you can set up WSL - windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Node.js version: Node.js versions >= 18
- Git: our Git workflow instructions show how to use git on the command line only for now

#

### Installing dependencies
You need this step whether you are developing for the web client or the mobile client. After cloning, change directory into the root of this repository, then install dependencies:
````
npm install
````

#

### Web Client: Launch in web browser
In the root of this repository, run the script command in the code block below to get the web client running locally on your computer, and in the web browser:

````
npm run web:serve
````

> Find the code for web client inside of the `apps/web-mzima-client` folder

### Web Client: Set up and connect to the backend platform API
After running the `web:serve` script command above, you should be able to open up the web client's user interface in the browser. 

The web client is currently connected to our staging API. This is set in the web client's `env.json` file with:

````
"backend_url": "https://mzima-dev-api.staging.ush.zone/",
````

You can choose to set up your own backend locally using our [backend platform API](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform), and connect it to the web client instead. To set up the backend for yourself, follow the installation instructions on the [backend API's readme](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform#setup-essentials). Then replace the `"backend_url"` value in the web client's `env.json` file with the url of the backend you have successfully setup.


#

### Mobile Client: Launch in web browser

> Ensure you have run the `install` script command in the root of this repository as directed earlier, before you proceed

In the root of this repository, run the script command in the code block below to get the mobile client running locally on your computer, and in the web browser:

````
npm run mobile:serve
````

If this is the first time you are trying to run the mobile client in the browser, you will need to do some setup otherwise the `mobile:serve` script command will not run the mobile client successfully. The setup steps have been outlined below.

Change directory into `apps/mobile-mzima-client` folder to install dependencies specific to the mobile client:

````
npm install
````

Mac OS users may encounter some install request timeout errors caused by vips at this point (for persons using other Operating Systems you can let the community know if you face any install problems and the solution so that it can be documented accordingly). If you are using homebrew, check or get vips info from homebrew:

````
brew info vips
````

Then Re-install vips:

````
brew reinstall vips
````

After reinstalling vips, run the `install` script command in the `apps/mobile-mzima-client` folder again. It should now install the mobile client dependencies successfully.

Change directory back into the root of this repository and run the `mobile:serve` script command again. The mobile client should now run in the web browser successfully.

### Mobile Client: Launch in Android emulator

> First try to successfully launch the mobile client in the web browser, as the initial setup steps have been addressed in that section

Have (up-to-date version of) android studio installed on your computer so that you can be able to open up the user interface on an android mobile phone emulator.

If you can run the `mobile:serve` script command above without problems, then you can already launch the mobile client on an android emulator if you have android studio and have set up an android emulator in android studio.

The android emulator devices that would generally work are android versions 11.0 and above.

Once android studio and emulators have been set up, in the root of this repository, always run the script command in the code block below anytime you want to launch/open the mobile client on an android phone emulator:

````
npm run mobile:android
````


### Mobile Client: Launch in iOS simulator

> First try to successfully launch the mobile client in the web browser, as the initial steps have been addressed in that section

You can only develop the mobile client for iOS or run an iOS simulator with a Mac OS computer.

First visit the [iOS requirements section of the capacitor js documentation](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup#ios-requirements) and ensure that you have these 4 tools are installed or updated successfully: Xcode, Xcode Command Line Tools, Homebrew, Cocoapods.

Once those needed tools have been set up, in the root of this repository, always run the script command in the code block below anytime you want to launch/open the mobile client on an ios simulator:

````
npm run mobile:ios
````

If you run into any errors while running the `mobile:ios` script command, you can always run the command in the code block below to outline problems and what you can do to resolve it:

````
npx cap sync ios
````

Once the `cap sync` script command is successful, change directory back into the root of this repository and run the `mobile:ios` script command again. The mobile client should now run in xcode and ios simulator successfully.
