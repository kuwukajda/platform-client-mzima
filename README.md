````
npm run mobile:serve
````

> Find the code for mobile client inside of the `apps/mobile-mzima-client`

#### Mobile client: Further help incase of errors

If the mobile:serve script command above does not successfully run the app and there are errors in the terminal, you probably don't have capacitor and/or some other dependencies installed in other to run the mobile client. Do the following:

Change directory into `apps/mobile-mzima-client`. Then install dependencies:

````
npm install
````

You could be having npm installation issues if you don't have vips on your computer or if it's not updated. Install or re-install vips:
> Note: this vips installation instruction is for mac. For other Operating Systems, you can help improve this doc by letting us know how you were able to resolve this issue.

Get vips info from homebrew:

````
brew info vips
````

Re-install vips:

````
brew reinstall vips
````

Continue from here...

Change directory back to the root of the repository and run the mobile:serve script command again. If client successfully runs, you don't need to take any further step. 

If there are still errors in the console,

### Setting up the backend platform API locally
After launching any of the clients following the instructions in the **Web Client: Development** or the **Mobile Client: Development** sections above depending on the client you are running, you should be able to open up the user interface in the browser (web client) or on a simulator (mobile client). 

The web client and mobile client currently connected to our staging API. This is set in the web or mobile client's `env.json` file with:

````
"backend_url": "https://mzima-dev-api.staging.ush.zone/",
````

You can choose to set up your own backend locally using our [backend platform API](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform), and connect it to the web or mobile client instead. To set up the backend for your self, follow the installation instructions on the [backend API's readme](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform#setup-essentials). Then replace the `"backend_url"` value in the web or mobile client's `env.json` file with the url of the backend you have successfully setup.
